# Soul Reads

Soul Reads was developed to give users a simple yet fun experience where they can keep a log of books they are currently reading. We also added features where the user could update their wishlist and add comments about the books. The user can delete and edit books at their leisure. 

## Future Features

For our capstone project, we plan to implement user interaction. User interaction will be based on their genre compatibility. Also, users can add likes to different users' posts along with adding a comments.
